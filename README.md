# ðŸš€ Sputnik Gemini Browser

Sputnik is a browser for MacOS that uses the Gemini Protocol, a lightweight, low-energy protocol similar to HTTPS for reading gently marked up text documents. It uses SwiftUI, a new UI framework from Apple similar to Facebook's React Native. It's still a work in progress, but it's mature enough to experience most of the current Geminispace.

To install it you'll need the latest version of Xcode. Open up the Sputnik.xcodeproj file and hit âŒ˜R.
