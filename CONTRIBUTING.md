You want to contribute to Sputnik? No Problem! Just open up a pull request to the `staging` branch!

## main app
The main app is based on SwiftUI. To install it you'll need the latest version of Xcode. Open up the Sputnik.xcodeproj file in XCode and hit `⌘R` to run the app. To stop that process just hit `⌘.`.

## landingpage
The landingpage can be found in the `docs/` directory. It's build with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).
To ensure, all your styles you've added, run `npm run purge` in the docs folder to ensure all tailwind styles are included into the production css file (`tailwind.css`).
